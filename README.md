# Null Movement
Null movement scripts allow players to move in the direction they intend without interruption or stopping when pressing opposing movement keys (e.g., left and right at the same time). These scripts cancel the stopping effect caused by simultaneous key presses, allowing faster strafing and more precise movement.
# Usage and Features
- Just click on the big button to activate fast strafing
- Supports strafing with "right and left" or "forward and backwards" movements
## Planned
- Minimizing the window to the tray
# Motivation
The primary motivation was to have a single-file executable, basically the most seamless way to start a null movement script. I also wanted to learn a bit of C#.
